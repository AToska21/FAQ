# âš¡ App Activations

Though you can install several apps, **you can activate only 3 apps at a time**. When you download an app, it will be activated by default. If you try to activate more than 3 apps, you will be prompted to deactivate a different app. You can re-activate an app by clicking the activate button in your apps list.
