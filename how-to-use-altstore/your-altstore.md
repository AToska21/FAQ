## AppleID

Once in AltStore, go to the settings tab and enter your AppleID (this should be the same as the one you used to install AltStore)

The "Browse" tab in AltStore is where you can find Apps available for you to sideload.&#x20;

From the browse tab you can also add sources, which allows you to put additional apps in your AltStore. [To learn more about sources, continue here](../sideloading-apps/beta-features/adding-apps-to-altstore-sources.md)

## My Apps

The "My Apps" tab is where you can see all of your activated/deactivated apps  &#x20;

### Activations&#x20;

Though you can install several apps, you can activate only three apps at a time. When you download an app, it will be activated by default. But if you try to activate more than 3 apps, you will be prompted to deactivate a different app. You can re-activate an app by clicking the activate button in your apps list.

### AppIDs Limit

Apps on AltStore also use up "App IDs" when they are downloaded. You can only use a total of 10 App IDs at a time, and each app uses a different amount of App IDs. Be sure to use the "view App IDs" link to see how many each app is using.&#x20;
