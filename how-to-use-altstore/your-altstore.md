## Browse

The "Browse" tab in AltStore is where you can find Apps available for you to sideload.&#x20;

From the browse tab you can also add sources, which allows you to put additional apps in your AltStore. [To learn more about sources, continue here](features/sources.md)

## My Apps

The "My Apps" tab is where you can see all of your activated/deactivated apps  &#x20;

&#x20;                                                ![](../.gitbook/assets/65605569-30ca6080-df5e-11e9-8dfb-15ebb00e10cb.png)

### Activations&#x20;

Though you can install several apps, you can activate only three apps at a time. When you download an app, it will be activated by default. But if you try to activate more than 3 apps, you will be prompted to deactivate a different app. You can re-activate an app by clicking the activate button in your apps list.

### AppIDs Limit

Apps on AltStore also use up "App IDs" when they are downloaded. You can only use a total of 10 App IDs per week, and each app uses a different amount of App IDs. Be sure to use the "view App IDs" link to see how many each app is using.&#x20;
