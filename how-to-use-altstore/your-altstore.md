## Browse Apps

The browse tab in AltStore is where you can find Apps available for you to sideload.&#x20;

If you are using the public version of Altstore, we recommend starting out by downloading Delta to check that everything is working correctly with AltStore. [You can go here to learn more about Delta](../trusted-apps/delta.md)
