# 🔗 Sources

Sources control what apps are available to download through AltStore. Adding sources will cause more apps to appear in the Browse tab, and will allow AltStore to automatically check for app updates.

To manage your AltStore sources, tap "Sources" in the top-right corner of the Browse tab. There, you can tap the ”+” button to add a source by entering its URL, or long-press a source and press ”Remove” to remove it from your AltStore.
