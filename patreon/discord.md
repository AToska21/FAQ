# ðŸ—£ Discord

The official AltStore Discord is where you can interact with the AltStore team and others involved with the community. We have dedicated support channels where you can receive active support from either us or our community helpers, as well as development channels where you can follow our progress and provide feedback.

To get access to the Discord, first sign up for the "Community Member" tier on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane)

You then need to follow Patreon's instructions for connecting your Discord to your Patreon account:

1. Log in to your Patreon account
2. Click on **Settings** from the left side menu
3. Click on **More** > [**Connected Apps**](https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps) from the menu bar
4. Click the **Connect** button next to Discord under App Integrations
5. Enter the email address or phone number you use to log in with Discord and your password and click the **Login** button
6. Click the **Authorize** button&#x20;
7. You've successfully linked Discord to Patreon! You may need to refresh the page

Once you've linked your account, you should now have access to the server!
