# ðŸ—£ Discord

The official AltStore Discord is where you can interact with the AltStore team and others involved with the community. We have dedicated support channels where you can receive active support from either us or our community helpers, as well as development channels where you can follow our progress and provide feedback.

To get access to the Discord, just sign up for the "Community Member" tier on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane) and check the welcome email for a link.
