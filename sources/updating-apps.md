**AltStore uses the ordering of versions to determine which versions are "newer."**&#x20;

To update your app, all you need to do is add a new version entry to the beginning of your versions array. AltStore automatically checks for app updates in the background and will notify users whenever one is available.&#x20;

AltStore will show that there is an update available when there's a newer version compatible with a user's device. **AltStore does not compare version numbers to determine if there is an update.**
